Description: Mutational signatures represent mutational
    processes occured in cancer evolution, thus are stable and genetic
    resources for subtyping. This tool provides functions for training
    neutral network models to predict the subtype a sample belongs to
    based on 'keras' and 'sigminer' packages.
